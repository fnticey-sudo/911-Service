# Deploy this Next.js shop (step-by-step)

## 1) Download & unpack
You have this folder. If you have the ZIP, unzip it locally.

## 2) Create a new GitHub repository
1. Go to https://github.com and create a new repository named `911-service-shop` (or any name you like).
2. Do NOT initialize with README/License (so you can upload files directly).

## 3) Upload files to GitHub
1. Open the new repo page.
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**.
3. Drag & drop **all files and folders** from this project (the contents of the ZIP root).
4. Commit changes.

## 4) Link repo to Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Click **Import Git Repository** and choose your new repo.
3. Vercel will detect **Next.js** automatically.
4. Click **Deploy**.
5. After deploy finishes, open your site URL.

## 5) Replace placeholder mod files
- Replace files inside `public/mods` with your real product ZIP files (do NOT upload illegal/cheat software).

## 6) Payments
- This project contains a simulated "Koop" link. Integrate Stripe (Bancontact & Apple Pay) and PayPal server endpoints for real payments.
